# why2025-badge-sys

<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

Raw bindings to the functions exported by the WHY2025 badge

### Example

```rust
#![no_std]

unsafe {
    why2025_badge_sys::printf(b"Hello, world!\n\0".as_ptr());
}
```

The bindings are autogenerated from the headers present in the firmware, so they are not exactly idiomatic rust.

The symbols definitely need more documentation. If you want to add some, please add it to the C code in the firmware repository, it will get picked up when rebuilding lib.rshift

### Interesting symbols

* [printf]
* [window_create]
* [window_framebuffer_create]
* [window_present]
